React
- open source view library created by facebook
- great tool to render the UI of modern web
applications.
- allows you to write HTML directly within js.
- to write js directly within js, include
{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }
- ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))
  - underneath, this function call is what places
  jsx into react's own lightweight representation
  of the DOM to optimize updating only specific 
  parts of the actual DOM

JSX

-
const JSX = <div></div>;

- nested jsx must return a single element
the parent element would wrap all of the 
other levels of nested elements
valid:
<div>
  <p>Paragraph One</p>
  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
  <p>Paragraph Three</p>
</div>
invalid:
<p>Paragraph One</p>
<p>Paragraph Two</p>
<p>Paragraph Three</p>

JSX Comments

-   {/* comment */}

JSX render elements to the DOM

- use ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)

JSX naming

- naming convention for all HTML attributes and
event references in JSX become camelCase
onclick -> onClick
onchange -> onChange

JSX self-closing tags

- self closing html tags like <br> must always be written as <br />
- elements can self closed as <div /> or closed as <div></div>
  - the first has no way to include anything inside
