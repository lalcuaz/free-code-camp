React
- open source view library created by facebook
- great tool to render the UI of modern web
applications.
- allows you to write HTML directly within js.
- to write js directly within js, include
{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }
- ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))
  - underneath, this function call is what places
  jsx into react's own lightweight representation
  of the DOM to optimize updating only specific 
  parts of the actual DOM

JSX

-
const JSX = <div></div>;

- nested jsx must return a single element
the parent element would wrap all of the 
other levels of nested elements
valid:
<div>
  <p>Paragraph One</p>
  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
  <p>Paragraph Three</p>
</div>
invalid:
<p>Paragraph One</p>
<p>Paragraph Two</p>
<p>Paragraph Three</p>

JSX Comments

-   {/* comment */}

JSX render elements to the DOM

- use ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)

JSX naming

- naming convention for all HTML attributes and
event references in JSX become camelCase
onclick -> onClick
onchange -> onChange

JSX self-closing tags

- self closing html tags like <br> must always be written as <br />
- elements can self closed as <div /> or closed as <div></div>
  - the first has no way to include anything inside

React Components

- everything in react is a component
(2 ways to make)
  - use a js func. defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component
  - stateless c -> one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data.
  - write a js func that returns jsx or null.
  - react requires func names to begin with a 
  capital letter.
-2nd way
  - ES6 class syntax

class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
  - extends React.Component gives access to react
  features such as local state and lifecycle hooks
  - it is best practice to call a component's 
  constructor with super and pass props to both. 
    - this makes sure the component is initialized
    properly
    - super calls the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component

Composition

  - can compose multiple react components with 
  composition
  - can create an parent component which renders other components as children
    - to render a component as a child, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag.
    
return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)
