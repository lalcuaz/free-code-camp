functional programming principles 
- don't alter a variable or object, create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function.
- declare function parameters. any computation inside a function depends only on the args passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable

callbacks
functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function.

first-class functions
Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value. in js all functions are first class

higher-order functions
The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value

lambda
when functions are passed in to or returned from another function, the functions passed in or returned can be called lambda
