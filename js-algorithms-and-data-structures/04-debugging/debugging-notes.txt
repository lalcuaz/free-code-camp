console -> .log()
        -> .clear() clears the console
        -> .warn(warningString) writes a warning to the console

typeof -> console.log(typeof []); will display object, js recognizes seven primitive(immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol, BigInt. and Object for mutable items.

""'' -> use one pair to capture the string and you can use the other within it. \ escape character 

false -> almost every value on its own in js evaluates to true except for 'falsy' values: false, 0, ""(empty string), NaN, undefined, null
